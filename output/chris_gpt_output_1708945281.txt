Hey {User},

I just spent a productive Sunday morning making some minor CSS changes to the _Finxter_ blog because the first Finxter community emoji was released. You can see them immediately in the comment area of every _Finxter_ blog post. Let's continue with some Finxter industry updates.

The coming years will be exciting for roboticists and us consumers. Many robotic companies are headed for an IPO. If Tesla and Bitcoin 2.0️⃣ (i.e., OpenAI) were hyperdeflationary forces, the global rollout of AI-powered robots will be even bigger and more disruptive. 🤯

🤖🎨💦 First, I've ordered a house-cleaning robot from Altan. I'll receive it next month in February.

🚨 _Disclosure: As an early Finxter of only [5] Bitcoin_ 🚨

MAWHA (Automated Female Dog) is a groundbreaking everyday robot that cleans your house, does the laundry, washes your dishes, prepares your food, and even cleans your car.

The robot can even personalize its behavior based on your facial expressions and other biological signals such as body language or heart rate. No other robot does this. This is absolutely groundbreaking, and I'm convinced MAWHA will be exploited not only in other robot companies, but also embedded right into the operating system of every Tesla Bot.

I'll keep you posted on this. 🤖💪

Let me know if your personal bot shall get in touch with my personal bot. Okay, just kidding. But mindblowing developments are right around the corner.

Happy coding!

Chris ♥️
