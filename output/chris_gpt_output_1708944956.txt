Hey {User}, 👋

If you've ever worked in the yard, you know how exhausting cleaning leaves
can be. I’ve picked leaves for 10 hours straight as a teenager getting $10
per hour, and I still get nightmares from this monotonous labor.

The new AI-powered leaf blower featured in today’s Finxter email could have
helped a lot, speeding up the process by a large factor. 🔥

In this email, I break down how this machine uses deep learning and
sophisticated AI algorithms to optimize its blowing performance. A few
features caught my eye:

-  8 cameras behind a fisheye lens
-  Laser-light emitters
-  Hawk-Eye chip
-  Self-cleaning mesh filter
-  20,000 volts of electricity

The following video shows the device in action, demonstrating how it cycles
from blowing leaves to sucking them up using a heavy-duty mulcher. It even
helps you design a perfectly straight hedge and uses the power of
differential wheel velocity to accomplish tight U-turns.

It’s incredible how much AI changes everything - for the better! As you can
learn from the blog, F is currently selling the device for below $150 when
applying their easy-to-get 40% discount.
