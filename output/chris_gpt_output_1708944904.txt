Hey {User}! This is one of the most unique products I've seen in a long time.

🍂AI Leaf Blower: A Must-Have Garden Tech for 2022?🍁

I found it on Twitter, 500,000 views in the last 24 hours! It's the next level in leaf blowers. The AI can identify holes, sticks, mud, and leaves.

Perception and decision-making are impressive: It assesses the weight and size of sticks, identifying problematic areas not only by visual information but also friction.

For example, if you collide with something hard, it'll learn from this feedback to avoid those spots in the future.

It also listens to the sound it makes on areas with a lot of leaves compared to an area with just a few leaves in order to gain a sensory perception of the leaf bed to optimize collection and airflow.

Overall a great machine for both pickup and distribution!

It's easy to see more products like this coming out and we're only at the beginning of AI integration in everyday life, first visually (showing the gardens), then providing communication and sensor data based on subscriber inputs.

A systems engineer with 5-10 years of experience could put this together quite easily so you won't see prohibitive costs anymore. This is a massive trend!
